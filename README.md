# ncdoc_data
North Carolina's Department of Public Safety posts "[http://webapps6.doc.state.nc.us/opi/downloads.do?method=view](all public information on all NC Department of Public Safety offenders convicted since 1972)." Inspired by a previous scrape by Fred Whitehurst, Isabella Langan, and Tom Workman, I wrote scripts to download the data and save in CSV format. 

Requirements:
